## Introduction
üíÅ Raw data was provided by Luke Barousse from his SQL course on his YouTube channel. The data set was built by collecting
data from job posting websites. The data set consists of job titles, salary, location, required skills, etc. Original data can be found [here](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). <br/>
‚ùìSQL queries can be found in [my project SQL folder](https://github.com/cybernewbee/Luke-SQL-Course-Advanced/tree/master/project_sql). 
## Background
This analysis tried to pinpoint top-paying jobs and associated skills. The actual questions I wanted to answer are the following: <br/>
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
## Tools I Used
- SQL: The most essential part of this analysis. All queries are made using SQL.
- PostgreSQL: the database management system.
- Visual Studio Code: A powerful coding tool
- Github: Storaging and showcasing queries and results
